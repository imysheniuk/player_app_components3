# Player created

It can:

* Display playlist
* Play song, by dbclick on it's name
* Delete song from list (with confirmation)
* Add new song, by some absolute url address 
* Playlist repeat mode (When last song finished = > the first one need to start, if you       choose some in the middle, next one need to play)  
* Local Storage used (not to lose added songs after browser was closed)

### My short description
I have an idea how to do some EventListeners with $scope.on, but need a little more time to sort it out. I can do it if needed.

I also used Local Storage but it works different on different laptops (I don't know the reason). So, to make sure you can open this app in your browser, I just comented it (src > app > app.js line: 38-41)
